A Todo List application in React is a user interface that allows users to manage a list of tasks they need to complete. 
## Steps to Run Project
Step 1: Install Node.js: To run a React application, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. 

Step 2: Create a new React application: Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to create your application.

## Future Improvements
1.User Authentication: Adding user authentication would enable users to save their tasks and access them from multiple devices.

2.Reminders and Notifications: The addition of reminders and notifications would help users stay on top of their tasks by sending alerts when a task is due or overdue.

3.Collaboration: Adding collaboration features would enable users to share their tasks with others and work on them together.
